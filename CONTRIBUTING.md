# Boshi Backend

Welcome! We are eager that you are interested in contributing to Boshi. This document will guide you through the process of contributing to the project.

## Environment Setup

We use Go v1.23.0 and are proud to use no dependencies!

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy of the repository.
2. Populate the `.env` file with the required environment variables. You can find a list of required variables in the `.env.example` file.
3. Run `make run` in the root directory to start the application.

## Branch Naming

When creating a new branch for your feature or bug fix, use the following naming convention:

```txt
<type>/<short_description>
```

Where `<type>` is one of the following:

- `feat`: Adding, refactoring, or removing a feature
- `bug`: Bug fix
- `hotfix`: Critical bug fix
- `test`: Experimentation

## Branch Previews

We have setup branch previews with courtesy to [deguzman.cloud](https://deguzman.cloud) which creates a deployment at `<branch_name>-api-boshi.deguzman.cloud` once you have pushed to your branch. Every subsequent push updates the deployment and it is removed once the branch is deleted.

**Note**: The branch name is made URL safe. For example, if the branch name were `feat/blue-buttons` the deployment would be `feat-blue-buttons-api-boshi.deguzman.cloud`.

We accept changes via pull requests. To submit a pull request and be sure to fill out the PR template.
